# Lecture 10a: Monte Carlo techniques

You now know basic python and how to manipulate arrays. You can write code which will preform mathematical operations on arrays and manipulate their sizes and shapes. 

You also now know how to find signals in data and you understand that real data and measurements are noisy. 

What we know need to understand now is when we have found a signal in data - how do we know that we have detected a signal?

In the next three lectures we'll cover an introduction to montecarlo methods and we'll demonstrate the application of that to significance and error analysis.

Along the way we'll try to exercise some of the techniques you have learned this term and that are important for your CW such as converting math to code, statistics and making sure your code is free of bugs.

Let's start by thinking about what montecarlo methods are. We have seen them once before on this course when we estimated the value of $\pi$. (Look this up on moodle or ask if you don't remember!)
