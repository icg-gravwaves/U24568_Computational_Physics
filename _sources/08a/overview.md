# Lecture 8a: Signal processing 1, Discrete Fourier Transforms 


In lecture 8a we begin our 6-lecture series on signal processing, which will be crucial for the upcoming second coursework. We begin by introducing discrete Fourier transforms and demonstrate the effect of aliasing. Do see the supplmentary videos on Moodle, and that were sent around by email.
