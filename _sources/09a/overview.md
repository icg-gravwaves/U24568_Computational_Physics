# Lecture 9a: Signal processing 3, Cross-correlation, convolution and matched-filtering 

In this lecture we want to explore the problem of identifying the presence of a known signal in well-understood noise. This problem has had applications in many areas of science (starting with radio communications) for a long time.

We will explore cross-correlation, convolution and matched-filtering as techniques for doing this.
