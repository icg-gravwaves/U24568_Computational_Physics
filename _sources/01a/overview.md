# Lecture 1a - Introduction and recap
 
Welcome to the 2nd year Computational Physics module. In terms of teaching methodology, this will be taught in a very similar manner to last year, except we will go deeper in terms of content and things will be more challenging.

In this first lecture, we will assume that you have forgotten everything from last year, so will do a whirlwind tour of the basics behind python that you will need. Please talk to us where things are difficult, in this week and going forward.
