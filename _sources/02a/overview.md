# Lecture 2a - Advanced Numpy and Data Manipulation 

Today's lecture will focus on some more features in numpy exploring some more tools for manipulating data and quickly accessing things that are desired.

Numpy features that we will cover today:

* Boolean indexing, `logical_and` etc.
* Built in methods of the `numpy.array` class, including `.any`, `.all`. `.where`.
* Transpose and reshaping arrays.
* The numpy `matrix` class (which is a sub-class of `numpy.array`)
* How to create tables of data, using the pandas library, to efficiently hold and access datasets in memory
 * How to write these datasets to file.
 * How to read such datasets in from file.
 * How to load supplied datasets into this pandas format.
 * How to efficiently manipulate these data arrays to quickly access, or plot, the data you are interested in.
