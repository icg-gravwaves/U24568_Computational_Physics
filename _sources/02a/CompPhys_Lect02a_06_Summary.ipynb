    "In this exercise, we'll be calculating the pressue of gas inside a closed 2D box as the box is heated. We'll be making use of the ideal gas law for this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the ideal gas law is PV = NkT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, P is the pressre, V is the volume, N is the number of molecules, k is the Boltzman constant, and T is the temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial condition, we'll assume standard temperature i.e. 273.15 K. We'll assume the box is cubic with sides of 1 m length and contains 2.5 x 10^25 molecules of gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boltzman constant is 1.380e-23 J/K\n",
    "1 atmosphere = 101325 N/m^2\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a function to calculate the pressure inside the box as the temperature is increased. N, T, and V should be inputs to this function. The pressure should be output in units of N/m^2\n",

    "2. Verify that at the initial temperature (273.15 K) the pressure is 94236.75 N/m^2\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Compute how the pressure in the box varies as the temperature increases between T = 273.15 K and T = 773.15 K. Your input array should contain 500 values. What is the  pressure in the box at the start and finish temperatures in units of atmospheres?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make a labelled plot showing the input temperature and output pressure, in units of atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Save the output from this function as a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Read in the saved table from the previous part of the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For each temperature in your table, calculate the average kinetic energy per molecule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{2}m v^{2} = \\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$$\n",

    "8. Add this as a new column to your table, and save the result.\n",
