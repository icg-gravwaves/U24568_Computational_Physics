# Lecture 1b - Problem solving (in python)

In the first lab you revised the level 4 python 'introduction to computational physics' course. 

In this course we will go further both with your python code 'knowledge' but also with your understanding of how to approach physics (or any other) problem via computational methods. In code, as with most tools, there are many methods of reaching the 'correct' answer.  We want you to be able to not just code what you have been told to, but to be able to think creatively about how best to solve a problem. 

We therefore want to introduce you today to how to problem solve using code.

We will look at a couple of simple problems for which will not use any special packages other than numpy arrays (we could do this entirely with list notation but numpy array makes maths more straightforward so we will use this for today).
