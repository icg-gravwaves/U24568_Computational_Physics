# Lecture 5a: Ordinary differential equations I 

We now begin covering specific content and techniques that will be needed to attempte the second coursework. This lecture will cover the basics of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and how to solve them numerically. This allows us to numerically evolve a system of ODEs in time, which is a common task in computational physics. This lecture is the first in a 3-part series on ODEs.
