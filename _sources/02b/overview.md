# Lecture 2b - Statistics I

This is the first of a two-part series introducing statistics in Python. 

Python has several packages which are optimised for statistics. In particular here we will be using the numpy random and scipy stats packages.

    numpy.random
    scipy.stats

In this lab we'll learn how to use these packages to plot statistical distributions by generating random variables in Python, and we'll try to calculate summary statistics such as the mean and variance of the distributions.

Additionally we'll see practical examples of the central limit therom showing that a Poisson process becomes Gaussian in the large number limit.

## The packages we will use:

Scan through the help pages related to numpy.random

https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html#random-sampling-numpy-random

and scipy.stats

https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html

think about why they might be useful and where they do the same thing.
