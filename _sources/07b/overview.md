# Lecture 7b: LaTeX

In this lecture we will learn how to use LaTeX to write documents. LaTeX is a typesetting system that is widely used in academia and industry to write scientific documents. It is particularly useful for writing documents that contain mathematical equations, tables, and figures. LaTeX is a markup language, which means that you write your document using plain text and then use special commands to format the text. This makes it easy to write documents that are well-structured and easy to read.

Coursework 2 will **require** you to write a report using LaTeX.
