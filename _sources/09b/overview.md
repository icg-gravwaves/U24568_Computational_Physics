# Lecture 9b: Code Optimization in Python (I) 

Accompanying our 6-part data processing course, we will do two lectures in code optimization. This, the first of these, will focus on how to optimize in pure python code. Looking in particular at efficient use of numpy and code complexity. In part 2 we will show how we can always leverage "the power of C" through Cython.
