# Lecture 6b: Midpoint Review

The aim of this notebook is to provide example questions (and solutions) for questions that are similar to those that are set in CW1. The questions are based on the material covered in the first 6 weeks. Hopefully this will help to reinforce your learning from earlier weeks. This lecture is structured as several notebooks with one question per notebook for you to try.
