# Lecture 4b: Data Cleaning 

In today's lecture we will explore several different methods to fit a model to astronomical data. In the first half of the lecture we will determine the Hubble Constant through 3 different model fitting methods. In the second half of the lecture you will take data from a periodic source to determine a model which best fits the data.

In this lecture we will:

*   Create a model and fit it to Hubble data
*   Determine the model via the scipy optimize function `curve_fit`
*   Determine the model via the numpy function polyfit
*   Understand how well these models fit the data via residuals and the coefficient of determination
