# Lecture 10a: Monte Carlo Techniques

You now know intermediate python and how to manipulate arrays. You can write code which will perform mathematical operations on arrays and manipulate their sizes and shapes.

You also now know how to find signals in data and you understand that real data and measurements are noisy.

What we now need to understand is when we have found a potential signal in data - how do we decide quantitatively if it is real or not, and how we do we determine what parameters (with errors/uncertainties!) the signal might have.

In the next three lectures we'll cover an introduction to monte carlo methods and we'll demonstrate the application of that to significance and error analysis.

Along the way we'll try to exercise some of the techniques you have learned this term and that are important for your CW such as converting math to code, statistics and making sure your code is free of bugs.

Let's start by thinking about what monte carlo methods are. We have seen them once before on this course when we estimated the value of $\pi$. (Look this up on moodle (lecture 3a) or ask if you don't remember!)
